            Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it like
            atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans. Nature is indeed God’s precious
            gift to Earth. It is the primary source of all the necessities for the nourishment of all living beings on
            Earth. Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the house we live in is provided by nature.
            Nature is called ‘Mother Nature’ because just like our mother, she is always nurturing us with all our
            needs.


            Whatever we see around us, right from the moment we step out of our house is part of nature. The trees,
            flowers, landscapes, insects, sunlight, breeze, everything that makes our environment so beautiful and
            mesmerizing are part of Nature. In short, our environment is nature. Nature has been there even before the
            evolution of human beings.
